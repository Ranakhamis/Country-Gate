It was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the church, perceived as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City, was popularly known as the 'Jerusalem' and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the Tsar.
